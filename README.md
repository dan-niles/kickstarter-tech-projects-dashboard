## 🔍 Visual Encoding Techniques

1. **Heatmap for Categories and Years:** We used a heatmap to visually encode project counts by category and year. Color saturation indicated project counts, offering insights into category popularity and trends over time.

2. **Clustered Column Chart for Success Rates:** To compare success rates across categories, we employed a clustered column chart, with categories on the x-axis and success rates on the y-axis.

3. **Scatter Plot for Category Popularity vs. Success Rate:** We created a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between category popularity (average backers per project) and success rates.

4. **Line Graph for Project Success Over Time:** Using circular colored dots and lines, we visualized the success and failure rates of projects over time.

5. **Average Funding Visualization:** We plotted average goal and pledged amounts by category, offering insights into funding patterns.

## 🌟 Significant Insights

**4) Success Rate Trends:** Most Kickstarter projects struggled to meet their goals, with success rates declining over time since 2013.

**5) Funding Disparities:** Categories like Sound, Camera Equipment, and 3D Printing received more funding than expected, while Space Exploration had the highest disparity between average goal and pledged amounts.
